- 👋 Hi, I’m @carter-mg
- 👀 I’m interested in astrophysics and philsophy! Pretty much anything in science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python, IRAF, Julia, MATLAB, among many other languages! 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have completed the 2nd longest sportaineer climbing route in North America! (12 hours, Khyv peak!)
